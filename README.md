## Why it is better then all other FPS games
With the FPS series (FPS, FPS2, and FPS3), all of the games jurastically change on each game.

With FPS, it was simple, but nothing special compared to other games.

With FPS2, things started getting a little better. New technology was added like advanced AI bot system and other tools.

But imagine the leap between FPS and FPS2, how things got so much better. Imagine 20x that, and that's FPS3.

But back to the subject, FPS3 is unique from all other FPS games. Here's why:

- It has simple, yet realistic and high performance graphics
- It is a web game you can setup in your browser in seconds
- The features and UI controls are easy to use
- It has 10 different in-game modes
- It is completely free to play

## Documentation
In the documentation, you'll get an idea just how to play the game, use all the menus, and level up your game.

### Getting started

#### Starting a game
Like mentioned earlier, FPS3 and all FPS games in the series are browser games.

Which literally means you can open your browser, click a link and start playing.

*How do you do this though?*

- Go to [www.FPS3.ml](https://www.fps3.ml)
- To start a game, click <kbd>PLAY</kbd>
- Select your game mode by using the arrows
- Click <kbd>Start</kbd> and wait for players to join

And just like that, in 4 simple steps, you're playing an FPS game.

*No download payment, setup, sign up or anything.*

#### Keeping your info saved
If you didn't think it could get any better, you can also __sign up__ and keep things like __medals__, __kills__, __points__ and __profile information__ saved.

To sign up and keep your awesome progress saved,

- Go to [www.FPS3.ml](https://www.fps3.ml)
- Click <kbd>OPTIONS</kbd>
- Click __LOG IN/SIGN UP__
- Enter the following:

> Username: A short username to identify yourself (Not your real name!)<br>
> Email: A verified email address so you can save your account (incase of lost info, e.g., forgotten password).<br>
> Password: A secure password that no one can guess, but you. Do not use characters like "%", "^" and "#"

- Click <kbd>Submit</kbd>
- Verify your email
- Log in using that info

Just start playing games now, and all rewards and info will be saved!

#### Using the store
Even if you thought it stopped right there, you can widely customize the game too!

By buying items in the store, we mean with fake currency (points), FPS3 is a completely free game.

Read [How to get points]() to learn how to get points to buy stuff in the store.

To get new cool items,
- Go to [www.FPS3.ml](https://www.fps3.ml)
- Log in or sign up
- Go back to the menu
- Click <kbd>STORE</kbd>
- Buy whatever you want.

But you can't use the stuff you buy, unless you change it in your preferences.
